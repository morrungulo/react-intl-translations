# React Translations

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Purpose

My cousin who works mostly as a frontend software developer asked me whether I could write him a tool to edit side-by-side JSON translations to be used with https://react.i18next.com/. I thought to myself, why not as a first attempt at React?

## How to run

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`
### `yarn build`

Use the test data located in the `data` directory.

## Improvements

Too many to mention!
